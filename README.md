### Mediation Webpage

Business portfolio for a client who works as a mediator. The main idea of the project is to provide users with all the necessary information about the client's business, qualifications and the mediation process itself. 
In order to ensure that client will be able to manage the content independently, almost all of the content is being stored in the Sanity Studio CMS.
