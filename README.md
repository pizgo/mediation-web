### Mediation Webpage

Business website for a client who works as a mediator. The main purpose of the project is to provide users with all the necessary information about the client's business, qualifications and the mediation process itself. 
In order to ensure that client will be able to manage the content independently, most of the content is being stored in the Sanity Studio CMS.

The project is still under development - the whole design is more of a showcase of an information architecture, possible colour palette and layout. I'm waiting for the client's final decisions regarding the design and her input for the "offer" page.
